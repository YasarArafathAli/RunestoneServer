#The best way to set the database_uri is to set your environment variable WEB2PY_CONFIG to one of the following values along with an database environment variable for each configuration as follows:
#
# production - set DBURL
# test - set TEST_DBURL
# development - set DEV_DBURL
#

# If, for some reason, you do not want to use environment variables then you'll have to remember
# to edit this file every time you want to use a different database.
